# Project Two: MongoDB Dashboard for Grazioso Salvare

This repository contains the dashboard application I developed using MongoDB, the Dash framework, and a reusable CRUD Python module from Project One. The dashboard allows users to interact with the Austin Animal Center Outcomes data through dynamic tables and charts, making it easier to filter and visualize data relevant to rescue operations.

## Reflection and Responses

### 1. Writing Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable Programs
I write maintainable programs by using clear naming conventions, modular design, and thorough documentation. My CRUD Python module, which abstracts all database operations, allowed me to connect the dashboard widgets to MongoDB effortlessly. This modular approach not only simplifies code changes but also enables reusing the module in future projects or applications.

### 2. Approaching Problems as a Computer Scientist
I approach problems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable components and applying structured design patterns like MVC. For this project, I divided the work between the database (model), CRUD module (controller), and the dashboard (view), which differed from previous assignments by requiring full-stack integration. In the future, I would continue using iterative development and testing strategies to build scalable databases for various client needs.

### 3. The Role of Computer Scientists and Its Importance
Computer scientists develop efficient, scalable solutions that solve real-world problems, and this project is a prime example. By creating a dynamic dashboard, I enabled Grazioso Salvare to quickly filter and visualize critical data, improving decision-making in rescue operations. This type of work demonstrates how well-designed software can directly enhance an organization's effectiveness and responsiveness.
